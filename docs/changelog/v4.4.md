# v4.4 - Change Log

v4.4 features two new builtins, improvements in testing, and automatic generation of autocompletion suggestions backed by man page parsing. Plus there has been a lot of focus on improving _readline_ responsiveness

## v4.4.9000

### Breaking Changes

None

### Features

- readline: `f1` should work even outside of autocomplete

- readline: wider preview pane

### Bug Fixes

- readline: fix preview wrapping on long lines

- readline: image previews should scale to preview height

- readline: better handling of terminal resizing

## v4.4.8000

### Breaking Changes

- `alt`+`1`..`9` hotkeys replaced with `shift`+`f1`..`f12`. Changed because `alt`+numeric rarely worked ([read more](/user-guide/terminal-keys.md#recalling-previous-words))

### Features

None

### Bug Fixes

- `@IncManPages` `autocomplete` value for **Dynamic** directive renamed to `@IncManPage`, like the **IncManPage** directive

- readline: render glitch fixed with delayed completions racing against hint text updates

- readline: render glitches fixed when buffers are not being reset correctly after preview box has, or should have, closed

- readline: man page preview now removes backspace characters correctly from UNIX docs

- readline: man page preview now more reliably scrolls to the right line when a flag is highlighted in autocompletion

- readline: preview now works for list views as well as grid views

## v4.4.7000

### Breaking Changes

- **preview-enabled** `config` option removed. This actually doesn't break anything, just produces a warning. The `config` option was also undocumented and experimental

### Features

- Preview is now considered stable. Press `f1` while autocomplete is open to use ([read more](/user-guide/terminal-keys.md#preview-box))

### Bug Fixes

- readline: render glitch fixed with delayed path completions

- readline: excess white spaces removed from man page descriptions

## v4.4.x

### Breaking Changes

- 'Name' field dropped from `onCommandCompletion` interrupt (this field was never documented)

### Features

- New builtin, `round`, which can perform rounding operations on numerical inputs ([#630](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/630), [read more](/commands/round.md))

- Vastly improved automatic man page parsing. Now descriptions are pulled alongside the flags and results are cached

- `man-get-flags` now includes a `-d` / `--description` flag to expose the improved man page parser

- New builtin, `return`, which exits a given function scope (eg `function`, `private`, **Dynamic** block in `autocomplete`, etc)

- Improved `git` autocompletions

- `find` autocompletions added

- builtin profiles are now imported as separate modules. This makes debugging easier

- `/integrations` directory added to Murex source, the aim of which is to make it easier for people to contribute autocompletions and other integrations with common command line tools ([Github](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/tree/master/intergrations))

- readline: new word jump hotkeys `ctrl`+`left` / `ctrl`+`right` (PC)

- readline: new word jump hotkeys `option`+`left` / `option`+`right` (Mac)

### Bug Fixes:

- `test` would always run first in any block, regardless of the preferred order of execution. This was because `test (unit|state|config)` required altering the execution state of the shell. The drawback was that `test (run|define|report)` would also run unexpectedly. This lead to hacks like `try { test run * }` to force the correct order of operations. Now the parameters of `test` are checked to determine when to execute the builtin.

- `int` types couldn't be compared against `num` types with `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` operators

- readline: `^d` will not send EOF if line is not empty. The original behaviour was by design however after pressing `^d` a few too many times when I intended to press `^f` or `^r`, I decided the original design was wrong

- `FileRef` wasn't being set in `test`. This caused some tests to fail if they called private functions

- Check `~/.ssh/config` exists before trying to parse it in `getHostsFile` private (used for SSH and similar tools autocompletions)

- readline: lots of work done on speeding up redraws and overall responsiveness. eg buffered autocompletion menus

- readline: hint text should _never_ be displayed if disabled via `config`

- readline: soft timeout halved (this can be overridden via `config`)

- readline: cropped autocompletion suggestions in gridded layout were one character too short (off by one error)
