# What's new in murex v4.2 - Change Log

Murex usage has raised considerably in recent weeks. This release addresses a number of feature requests and bugs raised on Github.

### Breaking Changes

none

### Features

* new flag in `foreach`: `--step <int>`. This allows the `foreach` to jump indexes at a time. When used, all the lines jumped are merged into a JSON array and that is passed to the `foreach` nested code block

* new alias `builtin` => `fexec builtin`. This was added to bring more familiarity to those coming from Bash et al ([#608](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/608))

* on Darwin, Homebrew defaults are imported, just like you'd expect them to be from any other shell

* new hotkeys ([#611](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/611)) ([#613](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/613)):

  1. `ctrl`+`a`: jump to beginning of line

  2. `ctrl`+`e`: jump to end of line

  3. `alt`+`f`: jump forwards a word at a time

  4. `alt`+`b`: jump backwards a word at a time

  5. `ctrl`+`k`: clear line after cursor position

  6. `ctrl`+`l`: clear entire screen

  7. `ctrl`+`g`: same as `esc`

* `open` builtin should fallback to system default if type unknown ([#620](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/620))

* `pre-prompt-func` added to `config`. Block runs before the interactive prompt is displayed

* `post-prompt-func` added to `config`. Block runs after the interactive prompt has been exited but before any command lines have been executed

* **auto-cd** option added to `config`: `config: set shell auto-cd true`. This allows you to traverse directories without having to prefix `cd`. By default it is disabled

* Meta values added to `foreach`, `formap`, and `while`. Meta values are a `$.` variable that holds meta-information about the running block, such as the number of iterations in a loop

* `command` alias for `exec` (for familiarity with Bash)

* `builtin` alias for `fexec builtin` (for familiarity with Bash)

### Bug Fixes:

* brace encapsulated variables, eg `$(foobar)`, now autocomplete as expected

* improvements to inlining images in iTerm2 when shell running on top of `tmux`. It still doesn't work reliably but this is an issue with `tmux` rather than Murex

* `method` forwards exceptions rather than errors. This behaviour has been changed to surface issues as errors

* `profile_preload.mx` added to profile defaults. This will be loaded before any of the OS-specific profiles

* missing rune length check causing the shell to panic ([#617](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/617))

* fixed deadlock in flag parsing

* zero length string title bars should be ignored ([#614](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/614))

* minor improvements to documentation
