# What's new in murex v3.1 - Change Log

This release includes mostly bug fixes and new experimental features which are opt into. To enable all experimental features, set the environmental variable `MUREX_EXPERIMENTAL` to any value. Or you can enable specific features individually via `config

Breaking Changes:

- None

Features:

- `default` statement added to `switch` (this will deprecate `catch`, albeit `catch` will remain supported for compatibility)

- Option to change start directory: `config: set shell start-directory $path` (where $path is the working directory you wish to start the shell in)

- `onCommandCompletion` event no spawns a pty. This allows capturing of stdout while still presenting a tty to the executing process

- EXPERIMENTAL: preview files. This can be enabled via `config: set shell preview-enabled true`

- EXPERIMENTAL: preview images. This can be enabled via `config: set shell preview-images true`

- EXPERIMENTAL: tty buffer. This can be enabled via `config: set shell tty-buffer-enabled true`

- `ctrl`+`r` has been tweaked to make it more user friendly

- Long overdue SIGWINCH signal handler to reflow after terminal resized

- Lots of improvements to documentation

Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes:

- none

Bug Fixes:

- re-added `columns` data-type to fix `jobs` builtin

- added bang alternatives to the glob exception list
