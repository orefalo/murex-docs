# `man-get-flags`  - Command Reference

> Parses man page files for command line flags 

## Description

Sometimes you might want to programmatically search `man` pages for any
supported flag. Particularly if you're writing a dynamic autocompletion.
`man-get-flags` does this and returns a JSON document.

You can either pipe a man page to `man-get-flags`, or pass the name of the
command as a parameter.

`man-get-flags` returns a JSON document. Either an array or an object,
depending on what flags (if any) are passed.

If no flags are passed, `man-get-flags` will default to just parsing the man
page for anything that looks like a flag (ie no descriptions or other detail).

## Usage

    <stdin> -> man-get-flags [--descriptions] -> <stdout>
    
    man-get-flags command [--descriptions] -> <stdout>

## Examples

    » man-get-flags --descriptions find -> [{$.key =~ 'regex'}]
    {
        "-iregex": "eg: pattern -- Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.",
        "-regex": "eg: pattern -- True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular expression.  To match a file named “./foo/xyzzy”, you can use the regular expression “.*/[xyz]*” or “.*/foo/.*”, but not “xyzzy” or “/foo/”."
    }

## Flags

* `--descriptions`
    return a map of flags with their described usage
* `-d`
    shorthand for `--descriptions

## Detail

### Limitations

Due to the freeform nature of man pages - that they're intended to be human
readable rather than machine readable - and the flexibility that developers
have to parse command line parameters however they wish, there will always be
a margin for error with how reliably any parser can autodetect parameters. one
requirement is that flags are hyphen prefixed, eg `--flag`.
