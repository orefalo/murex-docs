## Detail

### JSON return

`get` returns a JSON object with the following fields:

    {
        "Status": {
            "Code": integer,
            "Message": string,
        },
        "Headers": {
            string [
                string...
            ]
        },
        "Body": string
    }

    The concept behind this is it provides and easier path for scripting eg pulling
    specific fields via the index, `[`, function.

    ### `get` as a method

    Running `get` as a method will transmit the contents of STDIN as part of the
    body of the HTTP GET request. When run as a method you have to include a second
    parameter specifying the Content-Type MIME.

    ### Configurable options

    `get` has a number of behavioral options which can be configured via Murex's
    standard `config` tool:

    config: -> [ http ]

    To change a default, for example the user agent string:

    config: set http user-agent "bob"

get: google.com

    This enables sane, repeatable and readable defaults. Read the documents on
    `config` for more details about it's usage and the rational behind the command.
