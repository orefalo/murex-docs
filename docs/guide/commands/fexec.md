# `fexec` - Command Reference

> Execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order of precedence.

## Description

`fexec` allows you to execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order
of precedence.

## Usage

    fexec: flag command [ parameters... ] -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

    fexec: private /source/builtin/autocomplete.alias

## Flags

- `builtin`
  Execute a Murex builtin
- `function`
  Execute a Murex public function
- `help`
  Display help message
- `private`
  Execute a Murex private function

## Detail

### Order of precedence

There is an order of precedence for which commands are looked up:

1. `runmode`: this is executed before the rest of the script. It is invoked by
   the pre-compiler forking process and is required to sit at the top of any
   scripts.

1. `test` and `pipe` functions also alter the behavior of the compiler and thus
   are executed ahead of any scripts.

1. private functions - defined via `private`. Private's cannot be global and
   are scoped only to the module or source that defined them. For example, You
   cannot call a private function directly from the interactive command line
   (however you can force an indirect call via `fexec`).

1. Aliases - defined via `alias`. All aliases are global.

1. Murex functions - defined via `function`. All functions are global.

1. Variables (dollar prefixed) which are declared via `global`, `set` or `let`.
   Also environmental variables too, declared via `export`.

1. globbing: however this only applies for commands executed in the interactive
   shell.

1. Murex builtins.

1. External executable files

You can override this order of precedence via the `fexec` and `exec` builtins.

### Compatibility with POSIX

For compatibility with traditional shells like Bash and Zsh, `builtin` is an
alias to `fexec builtin
