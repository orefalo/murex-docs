# `<stdin>` - Command Reference

> Read the STDIN belonging to the parent code block

## Description

This is used inside functions and other code blocks to pass that block's
STDIN down a pipeline

## Usage

    `<stdin>` -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

When writing more complex scripts, you cannot always invoke your read as the
first command in a code block. For example a simple pipeline might be:

    Â» function: example { -> match: 2 }

But this only works if `->` is the very first command. The following would
fail:

    # Incorrect code
    function: example {
        out: "only match 2"
        -> match 2
    }

This is where `<stdin>` comes to our rescue:

    function: example {
        out: "only match 2"
        `<stdin>` -> match 2
    }

This could also be written as:

    function: example { out: "only match 2"; `<stdin>` -> match 2 }

## Detail

`<stdin>` makes use of a feature called **named pipes**, which are a way of
piping data between processes without chaining them together as a single
command pipeline (eg commands delimited with `|`, `->`, `=>`, `?` tokens).

### What are Murex named pipes?

In POSIX, there is a concept of STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR, these are FIFO files
while are "piped" from one executable to another. ie STDOUT for application 'A'
would be the same file as STDIN for application 'B' when A is piped to B:
`A | B`. Murex adds a another layer around this to enable support for passing
data types and builtins which are agnostic to the data serialization format
traversing the pipeline. While this does add overhead the advantage is this new
wrapper can be used as a primitive for channelling any data from one point to
another.

Murex named pipes are where these pipes are created in a global store,
decoupled from any executing functions, named and can then be used to pass
data along asynchronously.

For example

    pipe: example

    bg {
        <example> -> match: Hello
    }

    out: "foobar"        -> <example>
    out: "Hello, world!" -> <example>
    out: "foobar"        -> <example>

    !pipe: example

This returns `Hello, world!` because `out` is writing to the **example** named
pipe and `match` is also reading from it in the background (`bg`).

Named pipes can also be inlined into the command parameters with `<>` tags

    pipe: example

    bg {
        <example> -> match: Hello
    }

    out: <example> "foobar"
    out: <example> "Hello, world!"
    out: <example> "foobar"

    !pipe: example

> Please note this is also how `test` works.

Murex named pipes can also represent network sockets, files on a disk or any
other read and/or write endpoint. Custom builtins can also be written in Golang
to support different abstractions so your Murex code can work with those read
or write endpoints transparently.

To see the different supported types run

    runtime --pipes

### Namespaces and usage in modules and packages

Pipes created via `pipe` are created in the global namespace. This allows pipes
to be used across different functions easily however it does pose a risk with
name clashes where Murex named pipes are used heavily. Thus is it recommended
that pipes created in modules should be prefixed with the name of its package.
