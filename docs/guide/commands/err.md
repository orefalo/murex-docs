# `err` - Command Reference

> Print a line to the STDERR

## Description

Write parameters to STDERR with a trailing new line character.

## Usage

    err: string to write -> <stderr>

## Examples

    » err Hello, World!
    Hello, World!

## Detail

`err` outputs as `string` data-type. This can be changed by casting

    err { "Code": 404, "Message": "Page not found" } ? cast json
    
However passing structured data-types along the STDERR stream is not recommended
as any other function within your code might also pass error messages along the
same stream and thus taint your structured data. This is why Murex does not
supply a `tout` function for STDERR. The recommended solution for passing
messages like these which you want separate from your STDOUT stream is to create
a new Murex named pipe.

    » pipe: --create messages
    » bg { <messages> -> pretty }
    » tout: <messages> json { "Code": 404, "Message": "Page not found" }
    » pipe: --close messages
    {
        "Code": 404,
        "Message": "Page not found"
    }
