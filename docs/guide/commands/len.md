## Command Reference: `len`

> Outputs the length of an array

## Description

This will read an array from STDIN and outputs the length for that array

## Usage

    `<stdin>` -> len -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

    » tout: json (["a", "b", "c"]) -> len
    3

## Detail

Please note that this returns the length of the _array_ rather than string.
For example `out "foobar" -> len` would return `1` because an array in the
`str` data type would be new line separated (eg `out "foo\nbar" -> len`
would return `2`). If you need to count characters in a string and are
running POSIX (eg Linux / BSD / OSX) then it is recommended to use `wc`
instead. But be mindful that `wc` will also count new line characters

    » out: "foobar" -> len
    1

    » out: "foo\nbar" -> len
    2

    » out: "foobar" -> wc: -c
    7

    » out: "foo\nbar" -> wc: -c
    8

    » printf: "foobar" -> wc: -c
    6
    # (printf does not print a trailing new line)
