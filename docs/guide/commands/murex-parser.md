# `murex-parser`  - Command Reference

> Runs the Murex parser against a block of code 

## Description

`summary` define help text for a command. This is effectively like a tooltip
message that appears, by default, in blue in the interactive shell.

Normally this text is populated from the `man` pages or `murex-docs`, however
if neither exist or if you wish to override their text, then you can use
`summary` to define that text.

## Usage

    <stdin> -> murex-parser -> <stdout>
    
    murex-parser { code-block } -> <stdout>
