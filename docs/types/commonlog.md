# `commonlog` - Data-Type Reference

> Apache httpd "common" log format

## Description

Apache httpd supports a few different log formats. This Murex type is for
parsing the "common" log format.

## Detail

The code here is very rudimentary. If you have large log files or need more complex
data querying then this data-type is probably not the right tool. Maybe try one of
the following:

- [Firesword](https://github.com/lmorg/firesword) - for command line analysis
- [Plasmasword](https://github.com/lmorg/plasmasword) - exports fields to an sqlite3 or mysql database

## Supported Hooks

- `Marshal()`
  Supported though no unmarshalling is currently supported
- `ReadArray()`
  Supported. Each line is considered an index (like with `str` data type)
- `ReadArrayWithType()`
  Supported. Each line is considered an index with `commonlog` data type
- `ReadIndex()`
  Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
- `ReadMap()`
  Not supported, currently a work in progress
- `ReadNotIndex()`
  Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
