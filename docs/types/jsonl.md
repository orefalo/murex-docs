# `jsonl`

> JSON Lines

## Description

The following description is taken from [jsonlines.org](http://jsonlines.org/):

> JSON Lines is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be
> processed one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text
> processing tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files.
> It's also a flexible format for passing messages between cooperating
> processes.

## Examples

Example JSON lines documents taken from [jsonlines.org](http://jsonlines.org/examples/)

### Tabulated data

    ["Name", "Session", "Score", "Completed"]
    ["Gilbert", "2013", 24, true]
    ["Alexa", "2013", 29, true]
    ["May", "2012B", 14, false]
    ["Deloise", "2012A", 19, true]

This format is equatable to `generic` and `csv`.

### Nested objects

    {"name": "Gilbert", "wins": [["straight", "7♣"], ["one pair", "10♥"]]}
    {"name": "Alexa", "wins": [["two pair", "4♠"], ["two pair", "9♠"]]}
    {"name": "May", "wins": []}
    {"name": "Deloise", "wins": [["three of a kind", "5♣"]]}

## Detail

### Concatenated JSON

Technically the `jsonl` Unmarshal() method supports Concatenated JSON, as
described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Concatenated_JSON):

> Concatenated JSON streaming allows the sender to simply write each JSON
> object into the stream with no delimiters. It relies on the receiver using
> a parser that can recognize and emit each JSON object as the terminating
> character is parsed. Concatenated JSON isn't a new format, it's simply a
> name for streaming multiple JSON objects without any delimiters.
>
> The advantage of this format is that it can handle JSON objects that have
> been formatted with embedded newline characters, e.g., pretty-printed for
> human readability. For example, these two inputs are both valid and produce
> the same output:
>
> #### Single line concatenated JSON
>
>     {"some":"thing\n"}{"may":{"include":"nested","objects":["and","arrays"]}}
>
> #### Multi-line concatenated JSON
>
>     {
>       "some": "thing\n"
>     }
>     {
>       "may": {
>         "include": "nested",
>         "objects": [
>           "and",
>           "arrays"
>         ]
>       }
>     }

...however in Murex's case, only single line concatenated JSON files
(example 1) are supported; and that is only supported to cover some edge
cases when writing JSON lines and a new line character isn't included. The
primary example might be when generating JSON lines from inside a `for` loop.

This is resolved in the new data-type parser `jsonc` (Concatenated JSON). See
line below.

### More information

This format is sometimes also referred to as LDJSON and NDJSON, as described
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON).

Murex's [`json` data-type document](json.md) also describes some use
cases for JSON lines.
