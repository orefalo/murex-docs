# Variable and Config Scoping

> How scoping works within Murex

A 'scope' in Murex is a collection of code blocks to which variables and
config are persistent within. In Murex, a variable declared inside an `if` or
`foreach` block will be persistent outside of their blocks as long as you're
still inside the same function.

For example lets start with the following function that sets a variable called
**foo**

    function example {
        if { true } then { set foo=bar }
        out $foo
    }

In here the value is getting set inside an `if` block but its value is is
retrieved outside of that block. `out` and `set` have different parents but
the same scoping.

Then lets set **foo** outside of that function and see what happens:

    » set foo=oof
    » $foo
    oof

    » example
    bar

    » $foo
    oof

Despite setting a variable named **foo**, the value inside **example** does not
overwrite the value outside **example** because they occupy different scoping.

## What Instantiates A New Scope?

A new scope is instantiated by anything which resembles a function. This would
be code inside events, dynamic autocompletes, open agents, any code blocks
defined in `config`, as well as public and private functions too.

Code inside an `if`, `switch`, `foreach` and `source` do not create a new
scope. Subshells also do not create a new scoping either.
