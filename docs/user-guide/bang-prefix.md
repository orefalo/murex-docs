# Bang Prefix - User Guide

> Bang prefixing to reverse default actions

Some builtins support a bang prefix, `!`, which provides a shorthand negative
action to default behavior. For example, `set` defines a variable where as
`!set` will undefine a variable.

Sometimes the shortcut will be logical, like a **not** operator, as is the case
with `and` where typically each result has to equal **true** normally or
**false** if used in `!and`.

Sometimes the shortcut will be more philosophical, such as with `config` where
normal operations is to query or set configuration but `!config` resets the
configuration to defaults (thus operating the same as `config default`).

Please read the respecting commands doc for details on whether it supports a
bang prefix and what the behavior of that prefix is.
