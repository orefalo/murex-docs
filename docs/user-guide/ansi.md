# ANSI Constants - User Guide

> Infixed constants that return ANSI escape sequences

ANSI Constants is a Murex convention of passing ANSI escape sequences into
strings. It uses the `{}` notation with the constant name placed in between two
curly braces. eg `{GREEN}`.

## Constants

Rather than duplicate the constants from source, and risk the documentation and
implementation drifting, this document will embed the source directly below.

```go
package ansi

### How To Read The Code Above

Each line will look something a little like

    "GREEN":   {27, 91, 51, 50, 109},

The part within quotes is the constant name, and the part that follows is the
sequence of bytes that are infixed.

So the example above will replace `{GREEN}` from within a string with the
byte values of 27, 91, 51, 50 and 109 (in that order).

## Unsupported Constants

If a constant does not exist in the above code, then the infix string is left
unedited.

    # Green spelt correctly
    » out: "{GREEN}PASSED{RESET}"
    PASSED

    # Green spelt incorrectly (ie so that it doesn't exist as a valid constant)
    » out: "{GREEEEN}PASSED{RESET}"
    {GREEEEN}PASSED

## Enabling / Disabling ANSI Escape Sequences

These sequences are enabled by default. To disable run the following:

    » config: set shell color false

You will need to add this to your Murex profile, `~/.murex_profile` to make
it persistent.
