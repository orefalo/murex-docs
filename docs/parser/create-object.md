# Create object (`%{}`) constructor - Parser Reference

> Quickly generate objects and maps

## Description

`%{}` is a way of defining objects in expressions and statements. Whenever an
`%{}` object is outputted as a string, it will be converted to minified JSON.

Object elements inside `%{}` can be new line and/or comma delimited. This
allows for compatibility with JSON but without the pain of accidentally invalid
comma management breaking JSON parsers. However a colon is still required to
separate keys from values.

Like with YAML, strings in `%[]` do not need to be quoted unless you need to
force numeric or boolean looking values to be stored as strings.

## Examples

**Object passed as a JSON string:**

    » echo %{foo: bar}
    {"foo":"bar"}

**The `%` prefix for the nested object is optional:**

    » %{foo: bar, baz: [1 2 3]}
    {
        "baz": [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ],
        "foo": "bar"
    }
