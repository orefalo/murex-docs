# Array (`@`) Token - Parser Reference

> Expand values as an array

## Description

The array token is used to tell Murex to expand the string as multiple
parameters (an array) rather than as a single parameter string.

## Examples

**ASCII variable names:**

    » $example = "foobar"
    » out $example
    foobar

**Unicode variable names:**

Variable names can be non-ASCII however they have to be surrounded by
parenthesis. eg

    » $(比如) = "举手之劳就可以使办公室更加环保，比如，使用再生纸。"
    » out $(比如)
    举手之劳就可以使办公室更加环保，比如，使用再生纸。

**Infixing inside text:**

Sometimes you need to denote the end of a variable and have text follow on.

    » $partial_word = "orl"
    » out "Hello w$(partial_word)d!"
    Hello world!

**Variables are tokens:**

Please note the new line (`\n`) character. This is not split using `$`:

    » $example = "foo\nbar"

Output as a string:

    » out $example
    foo
    bar

Output as an array:

    » out @example
    foo bar

The string and array tokens also works for subshells:

    » out ${ %[Mon..Fri] }
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri"]

    » out @{ %[Mon..Fri] }
    Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri

> `out` will take an array and output each element, space delimited. Exactly
> the same how `echo` would in Bash.

**Variable as a command:**

If a variable is used as a commend then Murex will just print the content of
that variable.

    » $example = "Hello World!"

    » $example
    Hello World!

## Detail

Since arrays are expanded over multiple parameters, you cannot expand an array
inside quoted strings like you can with a string variable:

    » out: "foo ${ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo ["1","2","3","4","5"] bar

    » out: "foo @{ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo  1 2 3 4 5  bar

    » %(${ ja: [1..5] })
    ["1","2","3","4","5"]

    » %(@{ ja: [1..5] })
    @{ ja: [1..5] }
