# Append Pipe (`>>`) Token

> Redirects STDOUT to a file and append its contents

## Description

This is used to redirect the STDOUT of a command and append it to a file. If
that file does not exist, then the file is created.

This behaves similarly to the [Bash (et al) token](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Appending-Redirected-Output)
except it doesn't support adding alternative file descriptor numbers. Instead
you will need to use named pipes to achieve the same effect in Murex.

## Examples

    » out: "Hello" >> example.txt
    » out: "World!" >> example.txt
    » open: example.txt
    Hello
    World!

## Detail

This is just syntactic sugar for `-> >>`. Thus when the parser reads code like
the following:

    echo "foobar" >> example.txt

it will compile an abstract syntax tree which would reflect the following code
instead:

    echo "foobar" | >> example.txt

### Truncating a file

To truncate a file (ie overwrite its contents) use `|>` instead.
