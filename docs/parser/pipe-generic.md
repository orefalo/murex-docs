# Generic Pipe (`=>`) Token - Parser Reference

> Pipes a reformatted STDOUT stream from the left hand command to STDIN of the right hand command

## Description

This token behaves much like the `|` pipe would except it injects `format
generic` into the pipeline. The purpose of a formatted pipe is to support
piping out to external commands which don't support Murex data types. For
example they might expect arrays as lists rather than JSON objects).

## Examples

    » ja: [Mon..Wed] => cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed

The above is literally the same as typing:

    » ja: [Mon..Wed] -> format generic -> cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed

To demonstrate how the previous pipeline might look without a formatted pipe:

    » ja: [Mon..Wed] -> cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja: [Mon..Wed] | cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja: [Mon..Wed]
    [
        "Mon",
        "Tue",
        "Wed"
    ]
