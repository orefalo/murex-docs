# POSIX Pipe (`|`) Token - Parser Reference

> Pipes STDOUT from the left hand command to STDIN of the right hand command

## Description

This token behaves much like pipe would in Bash or similar shells. It passes
STDOUT along the pipeline while merging STDERR stream with the parents STDERR
stream.

It can be used interchangeably with the arrow pipe, `->`, in shell scripts.

## Examples

    » out: Hello, world! | regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!

    » out: Hello, world!|regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!

In this example the first command is writing to STDERR rather than STDOUT so
`Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:

    » err: Hello, world! | regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!
