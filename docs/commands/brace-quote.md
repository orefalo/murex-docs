# `(` (brace quote)

> Write a string to the STDOUT without new line

## Description

Write parameters to STDOUT (does not include a new line)

## Usage

    (string to write) -> <stdout>

## Examples

```
» (Hello, World!)
Hello, World!

» (Hello,\nWorld!)
Hello,
World!

» ((Hello,) (World!))
(Hello,) (World!)

# Print "Hello, World!" in red text
» {RED}Hello, World!{RESET}
Hello, World!
```

## Detail

The `(` function performs exactly like the `(` token for quoting so you do not
need to escape other tokens (eg single / double quotes, `'`/`"`, nor curly
braces, `{}`). However the braces are nestable so you will need to escape those
characters if you don't want them nested.

### ANSI Constants

`(` supports ANSI constants.
