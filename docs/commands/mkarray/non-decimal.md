# Non-Decimal Ranges - mkarray

> Create arrays of integers from non-decimal number bases

## Description

When making arrays you can specify ranges of an alternative number base by
using an `x` or `.` in the end range:

    a: [00..ffx16]
    a: [00..ff.16]

All number bases from 2 (binary) to 36 (0-9 plus a-z) are supported.
Please note that the start and end range are written in the target base
while the base identifier is written in decimal: `[hex..hex.dec]`

Also note that the additional zeros denotes padding (ie the results will
start at `00`, `01`, etc rather than `0`, `1`...)

Please refer to [a (mkarray)](../../commands/a.md) for more detailed usage of mkarray.

## Usage

    a: [start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    a: [start..end,start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    a: [start..end][start..end] -> `<stdout>`

All usages also work with `ja` and `ta` as well, eg:

    ja: [start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    ta: data-type [start..end] -> `<stdout>`

You can also inline arrays with the `%[]` syntax, eg:

    %[start..end]

## Examples

    » a: [08..10x16]
    08
    09
    0a
    0b
    0c
    0d
    0e
    0f
    10

    » a: [10..08x16]
    10
    f
    e
    d
    c
    b
    a
    9
    8

## Detail

### Floating Point Numbers

If you do need a range of fixed floating point numbers generated then you can
do so by merging two decimal integer ranges together. For example

    » a: [05..10x8].[0..7]
    05.0
    05.1
    05.2
    05.3
    05.4
    05.5
    05.6
    05.7
    06.0
    06.1
    06.2
    ...
    07.5
    07.6
    07.7
    10.0
    10.1
    10.2
    10.3
    10.4
    10.5
    10.6
    10.7

### Everything Is A String

Please note that all arrays are created as strings. Even when using typed
arrays such as JSON (`ja`).

    » ja [0..5]
    [
        "0",
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "5"
    ]
