# `count`

> Count items in a map, list or array

## Description

## Usage

    <stdin> -> count: [ --duplications | --unique | --total ] -> <stdout>

## Examples

Count number of items in a map, list or array:

```
» tout: json (["a", "b", "c"]) -> count
3
```

## Flags

- `--duplications`
  Output a JSON map of items and the number of their occurrences in a list or array
- `--total`
  Read an array, list or map from STDIN and output the length for that array (default behaviour)
- `--unique`
  Print the number of unique elements in a list or array
- `-d`
  Alias for `--duplications
- `-t`
  Alias for `--total
- `-u`
  Alias for `--unique

## Detail

### Modes

If no flags are set, `count` will default to using `--total`.

#### Total: `--total` / `-t`

This will read an array, list or map from STDIN and output the length for
that array.

```
» a [25-Dec-2020..05-Jan-2021] -> count
12
```

> This also replaces the older `len` method.

Please note that this returns the length of the _array_ rather than string.
For example `out "foobar" -> count` would return `1` because an array in the
`str` data type would be new line separated (eg `out "foo\nbar" -> count`
would return `2`). If you need to count characters in a string and are
running POSIX (eg Linux / BSD / OSX) then it is recommended to use `wc`
instead. But be mindful that `wc` will also count new line characters.

```
» out: "foobar" -> count
1

» out: "foo\nbar" -> count
2

» out: "foobar" -> wc: -c
7

» out: "foo\nbar" -> wc: -c
8

» printf: "foobar" -> wc: -c
6
# (printf does not print a trailing new line)
```

#### Duplications: `--duplications` / `-d`

This returns a JSON map of items and the number of their occurrences in a list
or array.

For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated so that entry
will have a value of `2` while ever other entry has a value of `1` because they
only appear once in the quote.

```
» out: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit: \s -> count: --duplications
{
    "brown": 1,
    "dog": 1,
    "fox": 1,
    "jumped": 1,
    "lazy": 1,
    "over": 1,
    "quick": 1,
    "the": 2
}
```

#### Unique: `--unique` / `-u`

Returns the number of unique elements in a list or array.

For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated, thus the
unique count should be one less than the total count:

```
» out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --unique
8
» out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --total
9
```
