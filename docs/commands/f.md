# `f`

> Lists or filters file system objects (eg files)

## Description

`f` lists or filters lists of file system objects, such as files, directories,
etc. `f` provides a quick way to output file system items that confirm to
specific criteria.

You define this criteria by using +flags (eg `+s` for all symlinks) and
optionally then restricting that criteria with -flags (eg `-x` to remove all
executable items). All flags supported as `+` are also supported as a `-`.

By default `f` will return no results. You need to include +flags.

Output is a JSON array as this format preserves whitespace in file names.

## Usage

    f: options -> `<stdout>`

    `<stdin>` -> f: options -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

Return only directories:

    f: +d

Return file and directories but exclude symlinks:

    f: +fd -s

Filter out files in a list (eg created by `g`) using conditions set by `f`:

    g: '*.go' -> f: +f

    rx: '\.(txt|md)' -> f: +fw

## Flags

- `+`
  include files (pair this with any other flag apart from `-`)
- `-`
  exclude files (pair this with any other flag apart from `+`)
- `?`
  deprecated -- use `i` instead
- `D`
  regular directories
- `E`
  other read permissions
- `F`
  regular files (exc symlinks, devices, sockets, named pipes, etc)
- `Q`
  other write permissions
- `R`
  user read permissions
- `S`
  sockets
- `W`
  user write permissions
- `X`
  user execute permissions
- `Z`
  other execute permissions
- `b`
  block devices
- `c`
  character devices
- `d`
  all directories (inc symlinks)
- `e`
  group read permissions
- `f`
  all files (inc symlinks, devices, sockets, name pipes, etc)
- `i`
  irregular files (nothing else is known about these files)
- `l`
  symlinks
- `p`
  POSIX named pipes (FIFO)
- `q`
  group write permissions
- `r`
  read permissions (user, group, or other)
- `s`
  symlinks
- `w`
  write permissions (user, group, or other)
- `x`
  execute permissions (user, group, or other)
- `z`
  group execute permissions

## Detail

`+` flags are always matched first. Then the `-` flags are used to filter out
any matches from the `+` flags.
