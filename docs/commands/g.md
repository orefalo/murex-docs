# `g`

> Glob pattern matching for file system objects (eg `*.txt`)

## Description

Returns a list of files and directories that match a glob pattern.

Output is a JSON list.

## Usage

    g: pattern -> `<stdout>`

    [ `<stdin>` -> ] @g command pattern [ -> `<stdout>` ]

    !g: pattern -> `<stdout>`

    `<stdin>` -> g: pattern -> `<stdout>`

    `<stdin>` -> !g: pattern -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

Inline globbing:

    cat: @{ g: *.txt }

Writing a JSON array of files to disk:

    g: *.txt |> filelist.json

Writing a list of files to disk:

    g: *.txt -> format str |> filelist.txt

Checking if a file exists:

    if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file exists
    }

Checking if a file does not exist:

    !if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file does not exist
    }

Return all files apart from text files:

    !g: *.txt

Filtering a file list based on glob matches:

    f: +f -> g: *.md

Remove any glob matches from a file list:

    f: +f -> !g: *.md

## Detail

### Pattern Reference

- `*` matches any number of (including zero) characters
- `?` matches any single character

### Inverse Matches

If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
them, then you can use the bang prefix. eg

    » g: READ*
    [
        "README.md"
    ]

    » !g: *
    Error in `!g` (1,1): No data returned.

### When Used As A Method

`!g` first looks for files that match its pattern, then it reads the file list
from STDIN. If STDIN contains contents that are not files then `!g` might not
handle those list items correctly. This shouldn't be an issue with `frx` in its
normal mode because it is only looking for matches however when used as `!g`
any items that are not files will leak through.

This is its designed feature and not a bug. If you wish to remove anything that
also isn't a file then you should first pipe into either `g: *`, `rx: .*`, or
`f +f` and then pipe that into `!g`.

The reason for this behavior is to separate this from `!regexp` and `!match`.
