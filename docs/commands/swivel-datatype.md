# `swivel-datatype`

> Converts tabulated data into a map of values for serialised data-types such as JSON and YAML

## Description

`swivel-datatype` rotates a table by 90 degrees then exports the output as a
series of maps to be marshalled by a serialised datatype such as JSON or YAML.

## Usage

    `<stdin>` -> swivel-datatype: data-type -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

Lets take the first 5 entries from `ps`:

    » ps: aux -> head: -n5 -> format: csv
    "USER","PID","%CPU","%MEM","VSZ","RSS","TTY","STAT","START","TIME","COMMAND"
    "root","1","0.0","0.1","233996","8736","?","Ss","Feb19","0:02","/sbin/init"
    "root","2","0.0","0.0","0","0","?","S","Feb19","0:00","[kthreadd]"
    "root","4","0.0","0.0","0","0","?","I<","Feb19","0:00","[kworker/0:0H]"
    "root","6","0.0","0.0","0","0","?","I<","Feb19","0:00","[mm_percpu_wq]"

That data swivelled would look like the following:

    » ps: aux -> head: -n5 -> format: csv -> swivel-datatype: yaml
    '%CPU':
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    '%MEM':
    - "0.1"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    COMMAND:
    - /sbin/init
    - '[kthreadd]'
    - '[kworker/0:0H]'
    - '[mm_percpu_wq]'
    PID:
    - "1"
    - "2"
    - "4"
    - "6"
    RSS:
    - "8736"
    - "0"
    - "0"
    - "0"
    START:
    - Feb19
    - Feb19
    - Feb19
    - Feb19
    STAT:
    - Ss
    - S
    - I<
    - I<
    TIME:
    - "0:02"
    - "0:00"
    - "0:00"
    - "0:00"
    TTY:
    - '?'
    - '?'
    - '?'
    - '?'
    USER:
    - root
    - root
    - root
    - root
    VSZ:
    - "233996"
    - "0"
    - "0"
    - "0"

Please note that for input data-types whose table doesn't define titles (such as
the `generic` datatype), the map keys are defaulted to column numbers:

    » ps: aux -> head: -n5 -> swivel-datatype: yaml
    "0":
    - USER
    - root
    - root
    - root
    - root
    "1":
    - PID
    - "1"
    - "2"
    - "4"
    - "6"
    "2":
    - '%CPU'
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    "3":
    - '%MEM'
    - "0.1"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    - "0.0"
    ...

## Detail

You can check what output data-types are available via the `runtime` command:

    runtime --marshallers

Marshallers are enabled at compile time from the `builtins/data-types` directory.
