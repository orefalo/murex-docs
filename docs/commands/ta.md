# `ta` (mkarray)

> A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array of a user defined data-type

## Description

Murex has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating arrays. It works
a little bit like Bash's `{1..9}` syntax but includes a few additional nifty
features and the output format is user defined.

## Usage

    ta: data-type [start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    ta: data-type [start..end.base] -> `<stdout>`
    ta: data-type [start..end,start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    ta: data-type [start..end][start..end] -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

    » ta: json [1..5]
    [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "5"
    ]

    » ta: json [Monday..Sunday]
    [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday"
    ]

Please note that as per the first example, all arrays generated by `ta` are
arrays of strings - even if you're command is ranging over integers. Also
if you are only creating arrays in JSON then you could use `ja` instead.

## Detail

Please read the documentation on `a` for a more detailed breakdown on of
`ta`'s supported features.
