# `@g` (autoglob) - Command Reference

> Command prefix to expand globbing (deprecated)

## Description

**This feature is now deprecated and only applies to murex version 2:**

By default Murex does not expand globbing (`*` and `?` wildcards) instead
encouraging the use of `g` (and similar) inside a subshell. While the aim of
this is to promote correctness, it can be a little annoying while working in
the interactive shell. For this reason you can prefix any command with `@g` to
enable Bash-like globbing.

## Usage

    @g command ...

## Examples

    @g echo *

## Detail

As of Murex `2.9` and above it is possible to enable automatic globbing in
the interactive shell without having to prefix the command with `@g` by
enabling the following `config` option:

    config: set shell auto-glob true

It is enabled by default on from version 3.x onwards (and renamed to
`expand-glob`)
