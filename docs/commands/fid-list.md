# `fid-list`

> Lists all running functions within the current Murex session

## Description

`fid-list` is a tool for outputting all the functions currently managed by that
Murex session. Those functions could be Murex functions, builtins or any
external executables launched from Murex.

Conceptually `fid-list` is a little like `ps` (on POSIX systems) however
`fid-list` was not written to be POSIX compliant.

Multiple flags cannot be used with each other.

## Usage

    fid-list [ flag ] -> `<stdout>`

`jobs` is an alias for `fid-list: --jobs`:
jobs -> `<stdout>`

## Flags

- `--background`
  Returns a `json` map of background jobs
- `--csv`
  Output table in a `csv` format
- `--help`
  Outputs a list of parameters and a descriptions
- `--jobs`
  Show background and stopped jobs
- `--jsonl`
  Output table in a jsonlines (`jsonl`) format (defaulted to when piped)
- `--stopped`
  Returns a `json` map of stopped jobs
- `--tty`
  Force default TTY output even when piped

## Detail

Because Murex is a multi-threaded shell, builtins are not forked processes
like in a traditional / POSIX shell. This means that you cannot use the
operating systems default process viewer (eg `ps`) to list Murex functions.
This is where `fid-list` comes into play. It is used to view all the functions
and processes that are managed by the current Murex session. That would
include:

- any aliases within Murex
- public and private Murex functions
- builtins (eg `fid-list` is a builtin command)
- any external processes that were launched from within this shell session
- any background functions or processes of any of the above
