# `murex-update-exe-list`

> Forces Murex to rescan $PATH looking for executables

## Description

On application launch, Murex scans and caches all the executables found in
$PATH on your host. Murex then does regular scans there after. However if
you want to force a new scan (for example you've just installed a new
program and you want it to appear in tab completion) then you can run `murex-update-exe-list`.

## Usage

    murex-update-exe-list

## Examples

    Â» murex-update-exe-list

## Detail

Murex will automatically update the exe list each time tab completion is
invoked for command name completion via the REPL shell.
