# `runmode`

> Alter the scheduler's behaviour at higher scoping level

## Description

Due to dynamic nature in which blocks are compiled on demand, traditional `try`
and `trypipe` blocks cannot affect the runtime behaviour of schedulers already
invoked (eg for function blocks and modules which `try` et al would sit inside).
To solve this we need an additional command that is executed by the compiler
prior to the block being executed which can define the runmode of the scheduler.
This is the purpose of `runmode`.

The caveat of being a compiler command rather than a builtin is that `runmode`
needs be the first command in a block.

## Usage

    runmode try|trypipe function|module

## Examples

    function hello {
        # Short conversation, exit on error

        runmode: try function

        read: name "What is your name? "
        out: "Hello $name, pleased to meet you"

        read: mood "How are you feeling? "
        out: "I'm feeling $mood too"
    }

## Detail

`runmode`'s parameters are ordered:

### 1st parameter

#### try

Checks only the last command in the pipeline for errors. However still allows
commands in a pipeline to run in parallel.

#### trypipe

Checks every command in the pipeline before executing the next. However this
blocks pipelines from running every command in parallel.

### 2nd parameter

#### function

Sets the runmode for all blocks within the function when `runmode` is placed at
the start of the function. This includes privates, autocompletes, events, etc.

#### module

Sets the runmode for all blocks within that module when placed at the start of
the module. This include any functions, privates, autocompletes, events, etc
that are inside that module. The do not need a separate `runmode ... function`
if `runmode ... module` is set.
