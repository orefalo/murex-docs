# `cd`

> Change (working) directory

## Description

Changes current working directory.

## Usage

    cd path

## Examples

```
# Home directory
» cd: ~

# Absolute path
» cd: /etc/

# Relative path
» cd: Documents
» cd: ./Documents
```

## Detail

`cd` updates an environmental variable, `$PWDHIST` with an array of paths.
You can then use that to change to a previous directory

```
# View the working directory history
» $PWDHIST

# Change to a previous directory
» cd $PWDHIST[0]
```

### auto-cd

Some people prefer to omit `cd` and just write the path, with their shell
automatically changing to that directory if the "command" is just a directory.
In Murex you can enable this behaviour by turning on "auto-cd":

```
config: set shell auto-cd true
```
