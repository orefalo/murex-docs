# `ja` (mkarray)

> A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array

## Description

Murex has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating JSON arrays.
It works a little bit like Bash's `{1..9}` syntax but includes a few
additional nifty features.

**Please note that while this builtin is not marked for deprecation, it has
been superseded by the `%[]` tokens.** ([read more](/parser/create-array.md))

## Usage

    ja: [start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    ja: [start..end.base] -> `<stdout>`
    ja: [start..end,start..end] -> `<stdout>`
    ja: [start..end][start..end] -> `<stdout>`

## Examples

```
» ja: [1..5]
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "3",
    "4",
    "5"
]

» ja: [Monday..Sunday]
[
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday"
]
```

Please note that as per the first example, all arrays generated by `ja` are
arrays of strings - even if you're command is ranging over integers.

## Detail

Please read the documentation on `a` for a more detailed breakdown on of
`ja`'s supported features.
