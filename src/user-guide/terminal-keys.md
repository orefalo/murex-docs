# Terminal Hotkeys

## `tab`: autocomplete

Provides autocompletion suggestions. Press `esc` to hide suggestions.

## `ctrl`+`c`: kill foreground process

Pressing this will send a kill (SIGINT) request to the foreground process.

## `ctrl`+`d`: end of file

Send EOF (end of file). If the shell is sat on the prompt then this will exit
that running session.

## `ctrl`+`f`: find in autocomplete suggestions

This will allow you to perform a search through the autocompletion suggestions,
allowing you to quickly navigate complex command options or jump to specific
sub-directories.

By default the fuzzy finder will look for any item that includes _all_ of the
search words. However the search behavior can be changed if the first search
term is any of these:

* `or`: show results that match _any_ of the search terms. eg `or .md .txt`
  will match both markdown and txt files (when finding files in completion
  suggestions).

* `!`: only show suggestions that do not match any of the search terms. eg
  `! .md .txt` will match all files except markdown and txt files (when finding
  files in completion suggestions).

* `g`: show only results that match a shell glob. eg `*.txt`.

* `rx`: use a regexp pattern matcher instead of any fuzzy search. Expressions
  will be case insensitive and non-greedy by default.

The fuzzy finder search is not case sensitive.

Press `esc` to cancel search.

## `ctrl`+`r`: search shell history

This brings up your timestamped shell history as an autocomplete list with
regexp search activated. Using `ctrl`+`r` you can rapidly rerun previous
command lines.

Press `esc` to cancel history completion.

## `ctrl`+`u`: clear line

Clears the current line.

## `ctrl`+`\`: kill all running processes

This will kill all processes owned by the current Murex session. Including
any background processes too.

This function is a effectively an emergency kill switch to bring you back to
the command prompt.

Use sparingly because it doesn't allow processes to end graceful.

## `ctrl`+`z`: suspend foreground process

Suspends the execution of the current foreground process. You can then use job
control to resume execution in either the foreground or background. ([read more](../commands/fid-list.md))

## `esc` (aka "vim keys")

Pressing `esc` while no autocomplete suggestions are shown will switch the
line editor into **vim keys** mode.

Press `i` to return to normal editing mode.

### Supported keys

* `a`: insert after current character
* `A`: insert at end of line
* `b`: jump to beginning of word
* `B`: jump to previous whitespace
* `d`: delete mode
* `D`: delete characters
* `e`: jump to end of word
* `E`: jump to next whitespace
* `h`: previous character (like `ðŸ ”`)
* `i`: insert mode
* `I`: insert at beginning of line
* `l`: next character (like `ðŸ –`)
* `p`: paste after
* `P`: paste before
* `r`: replace character (replace once)
* `R`: replace many characters
* `u`: undo
* `v`: visual editor (opens line in `$EDITOR`)
* `w`: jump to end of word
* `W`: jump to next whitespace
* `x`: delete character
* `y`: yank (copy line)
* `Y`: same as `y`
* `[`: jump to previous brace
* `]`: jump to next brace
* `$`: jump to end of line
* `%`: jump to either end of matching bracket
* `0` to `9`: repeat action _n_ times. eg `5x` would delete five (`5`) characters (`x`)

### Full screen editing via `$EDITOR`

When in "vim keys" mode, press `v` to bring up the visual editor. The editor
will be whichever command is stored in the `$EDITOR` environmental variable.

## Recalling previous words

* `alt`+`1` recalls the first word
* `alt`+`2` recalls the second word
* ...
* `alt`+`9` recalls the ninth word

For example (code inside square brackets represent key presses rather than text):

    Â» echo two three four five six seven eight nine
    two three four five six seven eight nine
    Â» [alt+1]echo [alt+5]five
    
Please note this isn't currently supported on all terminal emulators.
