# What's new in murex v4.3 - Change Log

This brings improved support on Windows plus one breaking change from the previous release (v4.2)

### Breaking Changes

* `pre-prompt-func` and `post-prompt-func` have been replaced with `onPrompt` events: `event onKeyPress example=before { ... }`

### Features

* New events, `onPrompt`, triggered when the interactive prompt is at various stages

* **Dynamic** and **DynamicDesc** autocompletions can have their partial term prefix filter disabled ([read more])(https://murex.rocks/docs/commands/autocomplete.html#ignoreprefix-boolean-false) ([discussion]([#630](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/635)))

* New autocompletions: `gping`

### Bug Fixes:

* Improved Windows support. Arrow keys and other special keys are now handled correctly ([#630](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/630))

* Fix `ctrl`+`a` offset by 1 error ([#628](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/pull/628))
