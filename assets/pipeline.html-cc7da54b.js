A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently. The concept of pipelines was championed by Douglas McIlroy at Unix's ancestral home of Bell Labs, during the development of Unix, shaping its toolbox philosophy. It is named by analogy to a physical pipeline. A key feature of these pipelines is their "hiding of internals" (Ritchie & Thompson, 1974). This in turn allows for more clarity and simplicity in the system.`)],-1),f=t("h2",{id:"named-pipes",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#named-pipes","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Named Pipes")],-1),g=t("p",null,[e('The drawback with pipes is that it assumes each command runs sequentially one after another and that everything fits neatly into the concept of "output" and "errors".
