In this article is explore those opposing use cases and how different $SHELLs have chosen to address them.</p></blockquote><h2 id="a-very-brief-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-very-brief-history" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Very Brief History</h2><p>In the very early days of UNIX you had the Thompson shell which supported<br> pipes, some basic control structures and wildcards. Thompson shell was based<br> after the Multics shell, which in turn was inspired from <code>RUNCOM</code>. In fact the<br> &#39;rc&#39; extension often seen in shell profiles is directly taken from <code>RUNCOM</code>.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until a little later that variables were a feature in shells. That<br> came with the PWB shell, which was designed to be upwardly-compatible with the<br> Thompson shell, supporting Thompson syntax while bringing advancements intended<br> to make shell scripting much more practical.</p><p>While the inspiration behind modern shells, <code>RUNCOM</code>, is a program that<br> literally just ran commands from a file; it is this authors opinion that early<br> UNIX shells were originally designed to be interactive terminals for launching<br> applications first and foremost, with scripting as a feature that took a few<br> years to mature. Furthermore, the ALGOL-inspired scripting commands were<br> originally external executables and only later rewritten as shell builtins for<br> performance reasons. For example running <code>if</code> in the shell would originally<br><code>fork()</code> the executable <code>/bin/if</code> but that quickly became call a builtin<br> function that was part of the shell itself.</p><p>I believe it is these reasons why $SHELLs based on that lineage, be it the<br> Bourne shell, Bash or Zsh, all share a scripting syntax which very much feels<br> like it is extended from REPL usage.</p><h2 id="opposing-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#opposing-requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Opposing Requirements</h2><p>The problem with shell usage is it falls into two contradictory categories<br> equally:</p><ol><li><p>You need an interactive terminal that is optimized for the operators<br> productivity. Since it is a REPL environment, any instructions you do pass<br> are going to be write-many read-once. In other words, the syntax needs to be<br> quick to type because it&#39;s going to be typed often. However it doesn&#39;t have<br> to be particularly readable because you&#39;re not going to save and read back<br> whatever instructions you&#39;ve keyed into the REPL.</p></li><li><p>You need the ability to write short scripts. The language here needs to be<br> familiar because it is aimed at non-developers (otherwise they might just as<br> well use C, FORTRAN, ALGOL or others) and succinct (again, otherwise a<br> developer might as well use a compiled language). However it also should be<br> readable because scripts are saved, recalled, reused and often extended over<br> time. So they fall into the write-once read-many category.</p></li></ol><p>In an interactive program manager it makes sense to forgo quotation marks<br> around strings, commas to separate parameters and semi-colons to terminate the<br> line. Even the C shell, <code>csh</code> then later <code>tcsh</code>, doesn&#39;t follow C&#39;s syntax that<br> strictly -- instead understanding that brevity is required for interactive use.</p><p>When I first started writing my own shell, Murex, I originally started out<br> with syntax that was inspired by the C. A pipeline would look something like<br> the following:</p><pre><code>cat (&quot;./example.csv&quot;) | grep (&quot;-n&quot;, &quot;foobar&quot;)
</code></pre><p>While this came with some readability improvements, it was a <em>massive</em> pain to<br> write over and over. So I added some syntax completion to the terminal,<br> inspired by IDE&#39;s and how they attempt to minimize the repetition of entering<br> syntax tokens. However this didn&#39;t remove the pain entirely, it just masked it<br> a little. So I removed the redundant braces. But the enforced quotation marks<br> were still annoying, so I decided to make the quotation marks optional. Then<br> the commas were removed...and before I knew it, I&#39;d basically just reinvented<br> the same syntax for writing commands as everyone had already been using for a<br> multitude of decades prior. What started out as the example above ended up<br> looking more like the example below:</p><pre><code>cat ./example.csv | grep -n foobar
</code></pre><p>(please excuse the useless use of <code>cat</code> in these examples -- it&#39;s purely there<br> for illustrative reasons)</p><h2 id="the-traditional" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-traditional" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Traditional</h2><p>As I&#39;ve already hinted in the section before, Bourne, Bash, Zsh all fall nicely<br> into the first camp. The write-many read-once camp. And that makes sense to me<br> when I consider the evolution of those shells. Their heritage does stem from<br> interactive terminals firstly and scripting secondly.</p><p>The problem with traditional shells is that their grammar is lousy for anyone<br> who needs a write-once read-many language. Worse still, while a significant<br> amount of their grammar has now been included as builtins, for practical use<br> operators often find themselves inlining other languages anyway, such as awk,<br> sed, Perl and others. So it is understandable that a great many chose to do<br> away with traditional shells for scripting and instead use more other, more<br> powerful and readable languages like Python.</p><p>Unfortunately the same problems transfer the other way too, in that I have<br> already demonstrated why Python (and other programming languages) don&#39;t always<br> make good shells. While I will conceded that there is a loyal fanbase who will<br> swear by their Python REPL for terminal usage, and if they&#39;re happy with that<br> then I salute them, their usage is as niche as those who enjoy using Bash for<br> complex scripts. Perhaps the only language I&#39;ve used which translates well both<br> for terse REPLs and lengthier scripts is LISP.</p><h2 id="the-modern" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-modern" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Modern</h2><p>So how are modern shells addressing these split concerns?</p><h3 id="powershell" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#powershell" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Powershell</h3><p>Microsoft had the benefit of being able to start from a clean room. They didn&#39;t<br> need to inherit 50+ years of UNIX legacy when they wrote Powershell. So their<br> approach was naturally to base their shell on .NET. Passing .NET objects around<br> has a number of advantages over the POSIX specification of passing files, byte<br> streams, to applications. This allows developers to write richer command line<br> applications in their preferred .NET language rather than being tied to the<br> shell&#39;s syntax. However one could argue the same is true with POSIX shells and<br> how you can write a program in any language you like. But in Powershell those<br> other .NET programs feel more tightly integrated into Powershell than a forked<br> process does in Bash. Again, I put this down to Powershell passing .NET objects<br> along the pipeline.</p><p>Where Powershell falls down for me is in two key areas:</p><ol><li><p>Many of the flags passed are verbose. Calling .NET objects can be verbose.<br> Take this example of base64 encoding a string:</p><pre><code> [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes(&quot;TextToEncode&quot;))
</code></pre></li><li><p>Powershell doesn&#39;t play nicely with POSIX. Okay, I&#39;m arguably contradicting<br> myself now because earlier I raised this as a benefit. And in many ways it<br> is. However if you wish to run Powershell on Linux, which you can do, you<br> may find that you&#39;ll want to work with CLI tools that do &quot;think&quot; in terms of<br> byte streams. Many of these tools have equivalent aliases written in .NET so<br> you can appear to use them without escaping the rich programming environment<br> provided by Powershell. However you may, and I often did, run into a great<br> many scenarios where my expectations didn&#39;t match the practicalities of<br> Powershell.</p></li></ol><p>(I will talk more about the second point in another article where I&#39;ll discuss<br> pipelines, data types and the need for modern shells to understand rich data<br> rather than treating everything as a flat stream of bytes)</p><p>There is no question that Powershell is a more powerful REPL than Bash but it<br> definitely slides more towards the &quot;write-once read-many&quot; end of the spectrum.</p><h3 id="oil" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#oil" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Oil</h3>`,29),p={href:"https://www.oilshell.org/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b=s(`<blockquote><p>Oil is a new Unix shell. It&#39;s our upgrade path from bash to a better language<br> and runtime. It&#39;s also for Python and JavaScript users who avoid shell!</p></blockquote><p>The way Oil achieves this is a lot of how PWB improved upon the Thompson shell<br> in the 1970s. Oil aims to be upwards-compatible with Bash. Any command line or<br> shell script you can run in Bash should, eventually, be supported in Oil as<br> well. Oil can extend on that and support a syntax and grammar that is more<br> readable and sane to write longer lived scripts in. Thus bridging the conflict<br> between &quot;write-many&quot; and &quot;read-many&quot; languages.</p><p>This make Oil one of the most interesting alternative shells I have come<br> across.</p><h3 id="murex" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#murex" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Murex</h3><p>The approach Murex takes sits somewhere in between the previous two shells.<br> It attempts to retain familiarity with POSIX syntax but isn&#39;t afraid to break<br> compatibility where it makes sense. The emphasis is on creating grammar that<br> is both succinct but also readable. This mission was driven from originally<br> attempting to create something more familiar to Javascript developers then<br> falling back to some old Bash-ism&#39;s when I realized that for all of it&#39;s warts,<br> Bash and its kin aren&#39;t actually bad for quick REPL usage of C-style braces<br> over ALGOL style named scopes:</p><p><strong>POSIX:</strong></p><pre><code>if [ 0 -eq 1 ]; then
    echo &#39;0 == 1&#39;
else
    echo &#39;0 != 1&#39;
fi
</code></pre><p><strong>Murex:</strong></p><pre><code>if { 0 == 1 } then {
    echo &#39;0 == 1&#39;
} else {
    echo &#39;0 != 1&#39;
}
</code></pre><p>But since the curly braces are tokens, grammar like <code>then</code> / <code>else</code> become<br> superfluous words that only exist for readability. So then we can make them<br> optional. And you end up with a syntax that allows for a certain amount of<br> golfing in the REPL should the operator want to save a few key strokes</p><pre><code>if { 0 == 1 } { echo &#39;0 == 1&#39; } { echo &#39;0 != 1&#39; }
