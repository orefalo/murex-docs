The concept is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is &quot;unnamed&quot; and lasts only as long as the process. A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if no longer used. Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.</p></blockquote><p>Where Murex differs from standard Linux/UNIX is that named pipes are not special files but rather an object or construct within the shell runtime. This allows for more user friendly tooling and syntactic sugar to implemented around it while largely still having the same functionality as a more traditional file based named pipe.</p><h2 id="in-murex" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-murex" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Murex</h2><p>In Murex, named pipes are described in code as a value inside angle brackets.
